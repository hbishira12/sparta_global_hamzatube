 <p> Lions use different calls when communicating with each other:
   meows, roars, grunts, moans, growls, snarls, purrs, hums, puffs and woofs.
   Each sound has a different meaning.Lions roar to tell other lions where they are,
    to show how big they are and to warn lions from other prides to keep away from their home territory.</p>

     <p>A lion or tiger can roar as loud as 114 decibels, about 25 times louder than a gas-powered lawn mower.
       The cats are also aided by the strength of their vocal folds, which can withstand stretching and shearing
        as air moves past them and the folds vibrate.</p>

         <p>Both humans and animals yawn to become more alert,
           but humans tend to yawn when they are bored or sleepy.
           Animals yawn in an anticipated situation.
           When a human feels bored or sleepy, their blood flow becomes
           a bit sluggish and the brain gets less oxygen.As a result, they
            yawn in order to supply the brain with extra oxygen which helps
            them become more alert. Most research has suggested that, contrary
            to common belief, we donâ€™t yawn because our brains need extra oxygen,
            but because we need to become more alert.</p>
