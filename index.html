 <p>Just like human children, life for a lion cub is all about play.
   and above shows the male lion whilst the cubs play.
 So much more than just a fun way to pass the time, play
 also helps little lions develop and grow.
  By running, climbing and wrestling,
  they practice their gross motor skills and develop physical strength and coordination.</p>

           Male lions spend 18 to 20 hours a day snoozing, while females get 15 to 18 hours of shuteye.
          The lionesses spend more time hunting and taking care of cubs, which is why they get slightly less sleep.</p>
